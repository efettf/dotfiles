### ðŸ’¡ Tips

<details><summary>ðŸ§ª Flake host expansion</summary>

###

You can use this command if _nixos_ **is** your host name:
```bash
$ nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```
As . expands to _.#hostname.

</details>

<details><summary>ðŸ«§ Run rebuild as user</summary>

###

If you want to rebuild system without sudo you can run:
```bash
$ nixos-rebuild switch --use-remote-sudo
```
It will use sudo only if it needs to, so it won't run everything as root.
