Highly modular nixos configuration using suckless software, easily extensible by adding your own repositories in flake inputs and loading them in the hosts directory. Most of the stuff is done behind the scenes on modules repositories and here you can set up high-level settings exported by modules.

### üí® Features

- **Secret management by [sops-nix](https://github.com/mic92/sops-nix):** simple to manage secrets with easy interface and atomic rollbacks (even in a public repo).
- **Everything is done via modules:** this makes it easy to both manage and organize all your settings without having huge repositories, while still having all of values shared around.
- **Without [home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager):** most of the stuff you want to do on nixos could by done by wrappers or by symlinking files, home manager tries to do everything in nix syntax which is overboard in most cases.
- **Automatic theming:** everything has the same colors and is uniform by default using base16 framework, the color values are exposed by the [colors module](https://github.com/efettf/colors) (which doesn't use [nix-colors](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-colors)).


### üöß Status

This repository is **under very construction** and is very prone to breaking, luckily due to the nature on nixos its mainly due to user error, so if you fork this repository and update it only when needed, it will last as long as you wish. Nixpkgs input is pinned at **24.11 beta** and will most likely be like that till the next release.


### üöÄ Modules

This repository uses advanced nixos modules system provided by flakes to split the configuration to multiple repositories all sharing the same nixos settings and inputs. Here's a list of all of the required and optional modules (might create more in future):
