     };
   in {
     nixosConfigurations.nixos = mkSystem "nixos";
+    nixosConfigurations.host1 = mkSystem "host2";
   };
 }
```

Afterwards to generate hardware configuration for your host run:

```bash
$ nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/host2.nix
```

And to switch to your host:

```bash
$ nixos-rebuild switch --use-remote-sudo --flake ".#host1"
```

Make sure to replace _host1_ and _host2_ with correct names,
or even the same ones.
